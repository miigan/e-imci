Based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), eIMCI is a research project at the Ateneo de Manila University to initially aid health workers in diagnosing and managing childhood illnesses.

Development (including Pilot Testing with health workers) was done in partnership with the Ateneo Java Wireless Competency Center (AJWCC)/Blueblade Technologies, Inc., the National Telehealth Center of the Philippines, and the Ateneo Innovation Center (AIC).

Acknowledgment must also be given to the Department of Science and Technology-Engineering Research and Development for Technology (DOST-ERDT) for financially supporting the project for 2 years.

As of the moment, it can diagnose and manage General Danger Signs, Cough, Diarrhea, Fever (including Malaria and Dengue), and Ear Problem for children ages 2 months to 5 years old.

Further, it is now being continued at AIC to establish the system as a true open-source platform that would allow people to customize the decision trees so that they can add more cases for eIMCI using the IMCI booklet, translate the decision trees to their local languages/dialects, and use it for other healthcare or non-healthcare initiatives.

In particular, using the system's decision-tree-parsing capabilities, its current function as an intelligent medical diagnostics mobile tool for pediatric care is now being expanded to also include maternal care.
